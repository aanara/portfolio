<p style="font-family:Lucida Sans Unicode;">My name is Aarthi and I'm 16 years old. I live in Fremont, California, which is one of the awesomest places ever. I just finished
junior year in high school, and I'm spending my summer at the girls who code program at EA! I'm excited for senior year. 
My hobbies are coding, reading, and painting. This is my first webpage :) </p>
